# Yes, you are not crazy, this file is absolutely terrible and a trainwreck.

Instead of using absolutely any available web framework I decided to print all the information to the page is massive convoluded chunks of text.

Oddly enough, this is actually **very** fast and reliable so far as the page loads instantly with the text appearing rapidly after the page opens.

Could this be done better? Yes, in almost every single way. Will I be re-writing this? No, I cannot be bothered.
