# pupper.moe [This is still a work in progress and is not the current code for the pupper.moe site]

## Goals

I want to create a place where users can compare their stats with others and display their own skills the way they want to. They should then be able to connect with fellow players and learn more about how they line up amoungst their peers.

## Setup

* Install Go
* Clone this repository to ("C:/Users/Username/go/src/github.com/CCPupp/pupper.moe")
* Fill out 'secret.go' with all relevant information
* Take the 'secret.go' file and add it to your GoPath ("C:/Go/src/secret/secret.go")
* Run the server with "go run cmd/server/server.go"

All changes to go files requre a server restart, however changes to /web/ files should update after a browser refresh!
